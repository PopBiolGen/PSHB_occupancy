  abstract = {Polyphagous shot hole borer Euwallacea fornicatus Eichhoff was detected in Western Australia in September 2021, and an eradication campaign funded by the Commonwealth government is underway. As part of contingency planning, we examined the cost effectiveness of alternative control strategies that could be used to mitigate urban forest impacts and maintain the benefits of trees to the local communities if eradication was not feasible. At the time this work was undertaken, decision-makers were concerned about the potential need to replace all urban trees susceptible to attack. We considered this strategy alongside less destructive strategies and assessed their cost effectiveness in terms of material and labor costs and the loss of ecosystem services resulting from reduced tree foliage. Using a stochastic simulation model, we found that a strategy that involved pruning necrotic limbs and treating trees biennially with systemic insecticide was almost always more cost effective than removing infested trees and replanting to resistant varieties. We estimated this strategy would cost A\$55-110 million over 50 years, while tree removal would cost \$105-195 million. A third strategy using a mix of chemical suppression and tree removal was also considered in light of new information about the pest's host preferences. With an estimated cost of \$60-110 million, this strategy was only slightly more expensive than using chemical suppression alone and could actually lead to eradication if the host range is as narrow as recent survey data suggests.},

  abstract = {Nondetection of a species at a site does not imply that the species is absent unless the probability of detection is 1. We propose a model and likelihood-based method for estimating site occupancy rates when detection probabilities are {$<$}1. The model provides a flexible framework enabling covariate information to be included and allowing for missing observations. Via computer simulation, we found that the model provides good estimates of the occupancy rates, generally unbiased for moderate detection probabilities ({$>$}0.3). We estimated site occupancy rates for two anuran species at 32 wetland sites in Maryland, USA, from data collected during 2000 as part of an amphibian monitoring program, Frogwatch USA. Site occupancy rates were estimated as 0.49 for American toads (Bufo americanus), a 44\% increase over the proportion of sites at which they were actually observed, and as 0.85 for spring peepers (Pseudacris crucifer), slightly above the observed proportion of 0.83.},

  abstract = {We describe an approach for estimating occupancy rate or the proportion of area occupied when heterogeneity in detection probability exists as a result of variation in abundance of the organism under study. The key feature of such problems, which we exploit, is that variation in abundance induces variation in detection probability. Thus, heterogeneity in abundance can be modeled as heterogeneity in detection probability. Moreover, this linkage between heterogeneity in abundance and heterogeneity in detection probability allows one to exploit a heterogeneous detection probability model to estimate the underlying distribution of abundances. Therefore, our method allows estimation of abundance from repeated observations of the presence or absence of animals without having to uniquely mark individuals in the population.

  abstract = {Nonnative plant pests cause billions of dollars in damages. It is critical to prevent or reduce these losses by intervening at various stages of the invasion process, including pathway risk management (to prevent pest arrival), surveillance and eradication (to counter establishment), and management of established pests (to limit damages). Quantifying benefits and costs of these interventions is important to justify and prioritize investments and to inform biosecurity policy. However, approaches for these estimations differ in (1) the assumed relationship between supply, demand, and prices, and (2) the ability to assess different types of direct and indirect costs at invasion stages, for a given arrival or establishment probability. Here we review economic approaches available to estimate benefits and costs of biosecurity interventions to inform the appropriate selection of approaches. In doing so, we complement previous studies and reviews on estimates of damages from invasive species by considering the influence of economic and methodological assumptions. Cost accounting is suitable for rapid decisions, specific impacts, and simple methodological assumptions but fails to account for feedbacks, such as market adjustments, and may overestimate long-term economic impacts. Partial equilibrium models consider changes in consumer and producer surplus due to pest impacts or interventions and can account for feedbacks in affected sectors but require specialized economic models, comprehensive data sets, and estimates of commodity supply and demand curves. More intensive computable general equilibrium models can account for feedbacks across entire economies, including capital and labor, and linkages among these. The two major considerations in choosing an approach are (1) the goals of the analysis (e.g., consideration of a single pest or intervention with a limited range of impacts vs. multiple interventions, pests or sectors), and (2) the resources available for analysis such as knowledge, budget and time.},
